Description: Countains a couple of example datasets (count tables and metadata)
            as well as wrappers of packages and functions for the statistical
            analysis of diffenrentially abundant features. If data does not 
            already countain groups to compare, functions are provided to 
            generate artificial differences and thus benchmark methods included.
