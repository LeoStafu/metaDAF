## TODO

Overall improvement that are yet to be added :

- Filter ROC curves and results based on the FC of the feature across groups 
(results for low, med, high FC)
- install packages with remotes::install_github()
- Add details about method (stats, normalization...) in the roxygen (in fact add what was in the first methods.Rmd in the doc of the package)

# metaDAF

The goal of metaDAF is to wrap packages and functions for the statistical
analysis of differentially abundant features. If data does not 
already countain groups to compare, functions are provided to 
generate artificial differences and thus benchmark methods included.
